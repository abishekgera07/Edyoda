Q1. Name four of the main data types in Python.

Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets are generally considered the main types of data. 
Types, None, and Booleans are sometimes also classified this way. The integer, floating-point, complex, fraction 
and decimal are numerical data types and simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2 and text strings and byte 
strings in Python 3 are the types of string data types.


Q2. What does immutable mean and what three types of Python core data types are considered immutable?

An immutable data type is a type of object which cannot be modified after its creation. Numbers, strings, and tuples 
in Python fall into this category. Although you cannot modify an immutable object in place, you can always create a new one 
by running an expression.


Q3. What does sequence data type mean and which three types of data fall into this category?

A sequence data type is a collection of objects ordered by a specific position. In Python, Strings, lists, and tuples are the 
data types based on sequences. The Sequences share common sequence operations, such as indexing, concatenation, and slicing,
but also have type-specific method calls.


Q4. What does mapping mean and what kind of data type is based on mapping?

The term mapping refers to an object that maps keys to associated values. The Python dictionary is the only type of mapping
in the base typeset. Mappings do not maintain any left-to-right position order; they support access to stored data by key, 
as well as type-specific method calls.


Q5. What are decorators in Python?

Decorators are used to add some design patterns to a function without changing its structure. Decorators generally are
defined before the function they are enhancing. To apply a decorator we first define the decorator function. Then we write 
the function it is applied to and simply add the decorator function above the function it has to be applied to. For this,
we use the @ symbol before the decorator.


Q6. What is slicing in Python?

Slicing is used to access parts of sequences like lists, tuples, and strings. The syntax of slicing is-[start:end:step].
The step can be omitted as well. When we write [start:end] this returns all the elements of the sequence from the start 
(inclusive) till the end-1 element. If the start or end element is negative i, it means the ith element from the end. 
The step indicates the jump or how many elements have to be skipped


Q7. What are Keywords in Python?

Keywords in python are reserved words that have special meaning.They are generally used to define type of variables. 
Keywords cannot be used for variable or function names. There are following 33 keywords in python-
And, Or, Not, If, Elif ,Else,For and many more.


Q8. What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?

Arrays and lists, in Python, have the same way of storing data. But, arrays can hold only a single data type elements whereas 
lists can hold any data type elements.


Q9. What are functions in Python?

A function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called. To define a Python function, the def keyword is used.


Q10. What is __init__?

__init__ is a method or constructor in Python. This method is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/ instance 
of a class is created. All classes have the __init__ method.


Q11. What is a lambda function?

An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement.
Example:
a = lambda x,y : x+y
print(a(5, 6))


Q12. What is self in Python?

Self is an instance or an object of a class. In Python, this is explicitly included as the first parameter. However, this is not the 
case in Java where it’s optional. It helps to differentiate between the methods and attributes of a class with local variables.
The self variable in the init method refers to the newly created object while in other methods, it refers to the object whose method was called.

Q13. How does break, continue and pass work?

Break	- Allows loop termination when some condition is met and the control is transferred to the next statement.
Continue -	Allows skipping some part of a loop when some specific condition is met and the control is transferred to the beginning of the loop
Pass - Used when you need some block of code syntactically, but you want to skip its execution. This is basically a null operation. Nothing 
happens when this is executed.


Q14. How do you write comments in python?

Comments in Python start with a # character. However, alternatively at times, commenting is done using docstrings
(strings enclosed within triple quotes).


Q15. What is a dictionary in Python?

The built-in datatypes in Python is called dictionary. It defines one-to-one relationship between keys and values. 
Dictionaries contain pair of keys and their corresponding values. Dictionaries are indexed by keys.
Eg: dict={'Country':'India','Capital':'Delhi','PM':'Modi'}


Q16. What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it?

We use *args when we aren’t sure how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if we want to pass a 
stored list or tuple of arguments to a function. **kwargs is used when we don’t know how many keyword arguments will 
be passed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments.


Q17. What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?

Lists are mutable i.e they can be edited.	Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).
Lists are slower than tuples.	Tuples are faster than list.
Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]	Syntax: tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20)


Q18.  What is namespace in Python?

A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.


Q19. What are python modules? Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python?

Python modules are files containing Python code. This code can either be functions classes or variables. 
A Python module is a .py file containing executable code.Some of the commonly used built-in modules are:
os
sys
math
random
data time
JSON


Q20. What are local variables and global variables in Python?

Global Variables:
Variables declared outside a function or in global space are called global variables. These variables can be accessed by any function in the program.
Local Variables:
Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable. This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space.
